# Personal Expense Tracker

## Description
A Python-based personal expense tracker that helps users manage and categorize their expenses. Users can input expenses, categorize them, save them to a CSV file, and view a summary of their spending compared to a predefined budget.

This project allows users to:
- Track individual expenses
- Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Fitness, School)
- Save data to a CSV file for future use
- Get a summary of spending by category and compare it against a set budget

## Features
- **Add and Categorize Expenses:** Users can enter details of each expense and assign them to predefined categories (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment).
- **Save and Load Data:** Expenses are stored in a CSV file for easy access. This file is updated each time a new expense is added.
- **Summarize Expenses:** Provides a breakdown of total spending by category, total amount spent, remaining budget, and daily budget for the rest of the month.

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- No external libraries required (uses built-in Python libraries like `calendar` and `datetime`).
